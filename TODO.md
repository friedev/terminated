# TODO

Mechanics:
- Queue shotgun shot if LMB is tapped before cooldown expires
- Movement ability (short-duration intangible sprint, "phasing")
- Flocking: http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html
- Flamethrower (tap RMB for laser, hold for flamethrower)
- Enemy spawn animation (for telegraphing and general aesthetic coolness; use Particle2D)

Content:
- Replace splitter with spawner (linear growth instead of exponential)
- Thorn
- Straight line charger
- Boss (large, multiple attacks)

Graphics:
- Small explosion on enemy death (reuse bomb enemy smoke cloud particles)

Audio:
- Unique enemy death sounds?
- Mute ambient sounds after death
